                                                from synthetic materials, not natural like wool. Polyester suits become
                                                creased easily and are known for not being breathable. Polyester suits

                                                make the suit look cheap. The texture of velvet is luxurious and
                                                breathable. Velvet is a great choice for dinner party jacket and can be
